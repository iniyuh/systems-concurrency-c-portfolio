A series of systems programming assignments focused on low-level software concepts: memory management, concurrency, multithreading, and network communication in C.

---

## Topics Covered

* Process and thread management (POSIX)
* Inter-process synchronization with semaphores and mutexes
* Dynamic memory handling and debugging
* Socket programming and asynchronous I/O
* Systems-level tooling: Makefiles, Valgrind, Helgrind

## Build and Run

Each project includes a Makefile. Typical usage:

```bash
make
./main
```

Refer to each subfolderâ€™s README for details on arguments and expected output.

---

## Debugging & Testing

* Memory use verified with `valgrind`
* Race conditions detected via `helgrind`
* Socket communication tested with multiple client inputs
* Thread interactions checked using concurrency stress cases
